	<h3>About the Eucharist</h3>
	
	
	<p>
	<strong>Apostolic Tradition</strong><br>
	Catholics believe that during the consecration prayer at Mass, that the bread and the wine offered on the altar are miraculously changed into the substance of Jesus Christ. The primary reason they believe this is because the Apostles believed it and they passed on the belief to the Bishops who were their successors who passed it on to their successors who passed it on to their successors.The passing on of the basic contents of the faith is called Apostolic Tradition and the content of the faith that was passed on is called the Deposit of Faith. The belief in Jesus presence in the Eucharist or Communion has always be part of Christian Tradition. While doubted by a few small groups at various times in history, it was only widely doubted during the Protestant Reformation.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>St. Paul</strong><br>
	“Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself” (1 Cor. 11:27, 29). 
	</p>
	
		
	
	
	<blockquote>
	<strong>John 6: 47-58</strong> <br>
	47 "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. 48 "I am the bread of life. 49 "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. 50 "This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. 51 "I am the living bread that came down out of heaven ; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever ; and the bread also which I will give for the life of the world is My flesh." 52 Then the Jews began to argue with one another, saying, "How can this man give us His flesh to eat ?" 53 So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, 
	<strong>unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood</strong>, you have no life in yourselves. 54 "<strong>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life</strong>, and I will raise him up on the last day. 55 "<strong>For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink</strong>. 56 "<strong>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</strong> 57 "As the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also will live because of Me. 58 "This is the bread which came down out of heaven ; not as the fathers ate and died ; he who eats this bread will live forever."
	</blockquote>
	
	</p>

<p>
In the above passage, Jesus mentions four times that He is talking about true flesh and true blood. He contrasts Himself with the manna in the dessert which did not give eternal life. However, his words are very hard to grasp and many people grumble upon hearing them.</p>


<blockquote>
<strong>John 6:60-64b</strong><br>
Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this said, "This is a difficult statement ; who can listen to it?" 61 But Jesus, conscious that His disciples grumbled at this, said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble ? 62 "What then if you see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before ? 63 "It is the Spirit who gives life ; the flesh profits nothing ; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. 64 "But there are some of you who do not believe." 

</blockquote>


<p>
Many disciples left Jesus after he made these comments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>John:6:66-68</strong>
<br>
As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were not walking with Him anymore. 67 So Jesus said to the twelve, "You do not want to go away also, do you?" 68 Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. 
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>The People Who Will Eat Jesus</strong>
<br>
It must have been tough being among those who continued to follow Jesus after He his announcement that people would eat his flesh. Because many people left Jesus after He made those radical statements, those who stayed might have been looked at as "the people who think they are going to eat Jesus". Perhasp the Apostles received weird looks and laughs. Parents may have told their children, "Those are the funny people who think they are going to eat their master. They are crazy." Even the Apostles who stayed must have been wondering what specifically did Jesus mean by "eat my flesh". After that fateful day, a major definition of a follower of Jesus would be someone who thinks he/she is going to eat Jesus. Those who couldn't handle the teaching departed that day. To remain with Jesus was to believe you were going to eat His flesh and drink His blood. However, although Peter confesses that Jesus has the words of eternal life, we don't know that Peter understood "how" they were going to eat Jesus. Perhaps the Apostles believed Jesus but continued to wonder exactly when and how they would eat Jesus.
</p>

<p>
During the Last Supper Jesus said, "Take this, this is my body" and "Take this, this is the cup of my blood". When Jesus said these words, His comments from John chapter 6 must have been ringing in the Apostles ears. They must have thought "ah ha! This is what He was talking about when He said, 'Eat my flesh and drink my blood.'" But, before they would think it was mear bread and wine, they would remember how much he stressed, "true food" and "true drink". "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His Blood, you have no life within you." They Apostles must have thought, "This is it. This is His body and blood. This is what He was talking about."
</p>

<p>
Later, after Jesus' resurrection and after He walks with two disciples on the road to emmaus, He enters into their house, takes the bread, gives thanks, and gives it to them. The Gospel of Luke says, "Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and He disappeared from their site." Perhaps they recognized that He was present in the breaking of the bread. And, perhaps once they realized this new presence of Jesus, He disappeared from them because they no longer needed to see him in that way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Many Tabernacles</strong><br>
Catholics keep the consecrated hosts from Mass in fancy boxes called tabernacles. In Eucharistic Adoration, a consecrated host is exposed so it (Jesus) can be adored. If you can believe that the Eucharist is the true presence of Jesus, then you can see how, by implementing the Eucharist, Jesus has spread Himself out throughout the world more than He could have done had he remained on earth in his human body. He has increased his presence since the ascension not decreased it. When you consider all of the Catholic Churches throughout the whole world, you can realize just how vast is Jesus' Eucharistic presence.
</p>

	<h3>History of Adoration</h3>
	<p>

In the early centuries of the Church, the consecrated hosts were reserved after Mass and during the week in order to make the Eucharist available to those who could not make it to Mass, especially those who were sick. It is also believed that some monks kept the blessed sacrament nearby or in their hermitage locations in order to be in Christ's presence at all times. Bishops sent the Eucharist to one another as a sign of unity. In the life of St. Basil (deceased in 379), there is a description of Basil dividing the Eucharistic Bread into three parts. One he consumed, the second he gave to the monks, and the third he placed in a golden dove hanging above the altar.


</p>
<p>
In the life of St. Comgall (deceased 601), we read that St. Comgall was attacked by heathens. But, when they saw he was carrying the Eucharist in a container around his neck, they chose not to attack him ouf of fear of retalation by the God he was carrying. In a poem from the year 802, there is reference to the Blessed Sacrament being kept on the high altar at the abbey church at Lindisfarne in England. By the year 1000, regulations were put it in place to keep the sacred species under lock and key to protect them from theft and animals. 
</p> 

<p>
In the 11th Century, a monk named Berengar of Tours stirred the waters by stating that Christ was not present in the Eucharist. Pope Gregory VII insisted that the bread and wine do become the body and blood of Christ and that Berengar sign a document agreeing. Pope Gregory stated his faith in the Eucharist by saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine placed upon the altar are, by the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and life-giving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the consecration, there is present the true body of Christ which was born of the Virgin and offered up for the salvation of the world, hung on the cross and now sits at the right hand of the Father, and that there is present the true blood of Christ which flowed from his side. They are present not only by means of a sign and of the efficacy of the Sacrament, but also in the very reality and truth of their nature and substance.
</blockquote>

<p>
In the early 13th century St. Francis said:
</p>
<blockquote>Sacred Scripture tells us that the Father dwells in "light inaccessible" (I Timothy 6:16) and that "God is spirit" (John 4:24) and St. John adds, "No one at any time has seen God" (John 1:18). Because God is a spirit He can be seen only in spirit; "It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh profits nothing" (John 6:63). But God the Son is equal to the Father and so He too can be seen only in the same way as the Father and the Holy Spirit. That is why all those were condemned who saw our Lord Jesus Christ in His humanity but did not see or believe in spirit in His divinity, that He was the true Son of God. In the same way now, all those are damned who see the Sacrament of the Body of Christ which is consecrated on the altar in the form of bread and wine by the words of our Lord in the hands of the priest, and do not see or believe in spirit and in God that this is really the most holy Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.</blockquote>

<p>
Also in the 13ths century, Pope Urban IV instituted the feast of Corpus Christi to adore and emphasis the body of blood of Christ in the Eucharist. He also commissioned St. Thomas Aquinas to compose the Liturgy of the Hours for the feast. It was at this time that Aquinas wrote the still famous and referenced in this app hymns: <em>O Salutaris Hostia</em>, <em>Tantum Ergo Sacramentum</em>, and <em>Panis Angelicus</em>. In 1226, Kind Louis VII of France requested the Blessed Sacrament be exposed after his recent military victory. So many people came to adore Jesus in the sacrament that the exposition continued perpetually until 1792 during the French Revolution.
</p>

<p>
In the 14th century, some began to ponder whether Christ remained present in the Eucharist if the Eucharist were to be discarded or abandoned in an unfavorable place. The Pope insisted that Jesus was truly present in the Eucharist regardless of the Eucharist's location. Shortly after, Pope Martin VI confirmed, after it had been called into question, that Jesus was truly and completely present in both the consecrated bread and consecrated wine. By consuming only the consecrated bread or the consecrated wine, a person consumes the full substance of Jesus. </p>

<p>
The Council of Trent, in response to doubts raised by the reformation, stated:
</p>

<blockquote>
The Church of God has always believed that immediately after the consecration the true Body and Blood of our Lord, together with His soul and divinity, exist under the species of bread and wine. His Body exists under the species of bread and His Blood under the species of wine according to the import of the words. But His Body exists under the species of wine, His Blood under the species of bread, and His soul under both species in virtue of the natural connection and concomitance which unite the parts of Christ our Lord, who has risen from the dead and dies now no more.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Council of Trent also made it clear that Jesus could be worshipped and adored in the Eucharist, for it was truly Jesus, human and divine, in the Eucharist. In 1592, Pope Clement VIII wrote a document about a 40 hour devotion to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. The Benedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, created in 1654, take a vow of perpetual adoration. Other societies and Churches began perpetual adoration communities around this time as well. In 1731 Clement XIII provided more detailed instructions on how this 40 hour devotion could take place. Canon Law written in 1917 recommends that Churches where the blessed sacrament is reserved offer an extended period of exposition of the blessed sacrament each year to allow the faithful to meditate on the Eucharist. In addition, Canon Law states the Churches should make the Blessed Sacrament available, at least a few hours per day, to be visited by the faithful.

	<h3>Exposition</h3>
<p>
Eucharistic Adoration often begins with what is called "exposition", which refers to "exposing" the Blessed Sacrament so that the host can be seen directly. Often exposistion is accompanied by some prayers and songs. Common exposition songs and prayers appear below. If you are partaking in adoration in which the Eucharist has already been exposed, then the following prayers and songs will not likely be prayed or sung.

Immortal Godhead, One in Three. <br>
O grant us endless length of days, <br>
In our true native land with thee. <br>

											<h3>John 21:1-19</h3>
								
													1
								After this, Jesus revealed himself again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself in this way.a
								2
								Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee’s sons, and two others of his disciples.
								3
								Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We also will come with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
								4
								When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore; but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
								5
								Jesus said to them, “Children, have you caught anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.”
								6
								So he said to them, “Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something.” So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in because of the number of fish.
								7
								So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad, and jumped into the sea.
								8
								The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards, dragging the net with the fish.
								9
								When they climbed out on shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.
								10
								Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.”
								11
								So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three large fish. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.f
								12
								Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they realized it was the Lord.
								13
								Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them, and in like manner the fish.g
								14
								This was now the third timeh Jesus was revealed to his disciples after being raised from the dead.
								
								Jesus and Peter.
								15
								When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”* He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.”
								16
								He then said to him a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He said to him, “Tend my sheep.”
								17
								He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, “Do you love me?” and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” [Jesus] said to him, “Feed my sheep.
								18
								Amen, amen, I say to you,j when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”
								19
								He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had said this, he said to him, “Follow me.”

				1
						“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me.
						2
						In my Father’s house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?
						3
						And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be.
						4
						Where [I] am going you know the way.”
						5
						Thomas said to him, “Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?”
						6
						Jesus said to him, “I am the way and the truth* and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
						7
						If you know me, then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him.”
						8
						Philip said to him, “Master, show us the Father,* and that will be enough for us.”
						9
						Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
						10
						Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me is doing his works.
						11
						Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works themselves.
						12
						Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and will do greater ones than these, because I am going to the Father.

<h3>About Reposition</h3>
<p>As the time for Adoraton ends, a priest or deacon will proceed toward the Eucharist and kneel while the following songs and prayers are said. He will then stand, pick up the monstrance, and bless the people with the Eucharistic Host. This is a poweful blessing as the intention is for Jesus to bless the people directly. After the blessing, also called a benediction, the divine praises are often said or sung. </p>

											<h3>St. Faustina</h3>
								
								<p></p>
	I adore You, Lord and Creator, hidden in the Most Blessed Sacrament. I adore You for all the works of Your hands, that reveal to me so much wisdom, goodness and mercy, O Lord. You have spread so much beauty over the earth and it tells me about Your beauty, even though these beautiful things are but a faint reflection of You, incomprehensible Beauty. And although You have hidden Yourself and concealed Your beauty, my eye, enlightened by faith, reaches You and my soul recognizes its Creator, its Highest Good, and my heart is completely immersed in prayer of adoration.</p>
			<p>
			My Lord and Creator, Your goodness encourages me to converse with You. Your mercy abolishes the chasm which separates the Creator from the creature. To converse with You, O Lord, is the delight of my heart. In You I find everything that my heart could desire. Here, Your light illumines my mind, enabling it to know You more and more deeply. Here streams of graces flow down upon my heart. Here my soul draws eternal life. O my Lord and Creator, You alone, beyond all these gifts, give Your own self to me and unite Yourself intimately with Your miserable creature.</p>
			<p>
			O Christ, let my greatest delight be to see You loved and Your praise and glory proclaimed, especially the honor of Your mercy. O Christ, let me glorify Your goodness and mercy to the last moment of my life, with every drop of my blood and every beat of my heart. Would that I be transformed into a hymn of adoration of You. When I find myself on my deathbed, may the last beat of my heart be a loving hymn glorifying Your unfathomable mercy. Amen. 		</p>

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the lowly.
He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent away empty.<p>
</p>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel
for he remembered his promise of mercy,
the promise he made to our fathers,
to Abraham and his children forever. <p>
</p>
(Lk 1:46-55)

					<h3>Hail Holy Queen</h3>

	
	
	Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.

That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

					<h3>Te Deum</h3>

O God, we praise Thee, and acknowledge Thee to be the supreme Lord.
Everlasting Father, all the earth worships Thee.
All the Angels, the heavens and all angelic powers,
All the Cherubim and Seraphim, continuously cry to Thee:
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heaven and earth are full of the Majesty of Thy glory.
The glorious choir of the Apostles,
The wonderful company of Prophets,
The white-robed army of Martyrs, praise Thee.
Holy Church throughout the world acknowledges Thee:
The Father of infinite Majesty;
Thy adorable, true and only Son;
Also the Holy Spirit, the Comforter.
O Christ, Thou art the King of glory!
Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.
When Thou tookest it upon Thyself to deliver man,
Thou didst not disdain the Virgin's womb.
Having overcome the sting of death, Thou opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all
believers.
Thou sitest at the right hand of God in the glory of the Father.
We believe that Thou willst come to be our Judge.
We, therefore, beg Thee to help Thy servants whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy
Precious Blood.
Let them be numbered with Thy Saints in everlasting glory.

					<h3>Make Me a Channel of Your Peace</h3>

<p>
Lord, make me a channel of thy peace,
that where there is hatred, I may bring love;
that where there is wrong,
 I may bring the spirit of forgiveness;
that where there is discord, I may bring harmony;
that where there is error, I may bring truth;
that where there is doubt, I may bring faith;
that where there is despair, I may bring hope;
that where there are shadows, I may bring light;
that where there is sadness, I may bring joy.
Lord, grant that I may seek rather to 
comfort than to be comforted;
to understand, than to be understood;
to love, than to be loved.
For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.
It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.

<br><br>

- St. Francis of Assissi

	<h3>Why Praise</h3>
	<p>
	The 2nd Eucharistic Prayer begins with: 

	</p>
<blockquote>
It is truly right and just, our duty and salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy, through your beloved Son, Jesus Christ...
</blockquote>	

<p>
The 2nd Eucharistic Prayer notes, giving God thanks is our "duty and salvation". And, the prayer reminds us it is our duty "always and everywhere". However, sometimes we might find we haven't had a lot of training or experience in truly giving God thanks and praise. The following sections offer easy methods and tips for adding some more "thanks" into your life.
</p>

<p>
While we turn to God in thanksgiving primarily because He deseves it, many people find that answers to prayer come most frequently during times of praise. When we praise and thank God, we focus on Him, his greatness, His majesty, and His capabilities. By Praising, our faith in what God can do is increased and our minds become more open to His miraculous intervention. Praise also forces us to focus on the moment, for God is present in the moment. When our brains are "in the moment" they also tend to be more open to communication from God. As such, praise and thanks can be excellent ways for hearing or receiving answers to prayer. The next sections give you pointers for how to enter into the presence of God in praise.

	<h3>Praise Bank</h3>
	<p>
Some school workbook pages offer a "word bank" which is a box listing many possible answers to questions on the page. The bank serves as a guide to jog the memory of a student who can recognize the right answer but may not be able to think of the right answer on her own. In the same way, a praise bank appears below, to offer you phrases of praise and thanks that you can say if you have trouble thinking of them on your own.

	</p>
	<p>
	To use the bank, simply and prayerfully, read the phrases. If no one is in the chapel with you, you can say the phrases out loud. Eventually you'll learn to make up your own phrases and won't need the word bank. 
	</p>
	
	
	<blockquote>
	Praise you Jesus <br>Thank you Jesus<br>Glory to your name Lord God <br>You alone are holy 
		<br>You alone are the righteous one <br>You are the beginning and the end
		<br>You are the Alpha and Omega <br>Glory to God in the highest <br>Praise to Jesus
		<br>Alleluia<br>Thank you Jesus <br>Glory to your name <br>Holy are you lord God 
		<br>You are the messiah <br>You are the living God <br>You are the king of kings
		<br>You are the great I Am <br>You are our Savior<br>You are the redeemer
		<br>You are the glorious. <br>You are the prince of peace.<br>Thank you for your love. <br>Thank you for your creation
		<br>Thank you for life <br>Thank you for your generosity <br>Thank you for your greatness
		<br>Glory to the Father <br>Glory to the Son <br>Glory to the Holy Spirit

	<h3>Timed Praise</h3>
	<p>
	
	You may at some point consider picking a time limit and attempting to give God thanks and praise for the duration of the time limit. 5 or 10 minutes is a good challenge. Many times when we first try to praise for 5 minutes, we find that we run out of steam after just 45 seconds. The challenge of the time helps us to decide and choose to give God praise. Usually after working past the first couple minutes, the Holy Spirit comes to our aid and lifts up our minds and hearts to heaven and makes the praising blessed and blissful. In many cases, you may find yourself forgetting about the clock for 20 minutes or more. Very often after a long period of praise, the Holy Spirit will calm your spirit and invite you to simply listen in the quiet. Many deep insights can come from the Lord in the peaceful and powerful moments after praise.

		<strong>Luke 1:68-79 	
</strong> 	
<p>
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;
he has come to his people and set them free.
He has raised up for us a mighty savior,
born of the house of his servant David.
<p>
Through his holy prophets he promised of old
that he would save us from our enemies,
from the hands of all who hate us.
He promised to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember his holy covenant.
<p>
This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
to set us free from the hands of our enemies,
free to worship him without fear,
holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.
<p>
You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High;
for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,
to give his people knowledge of salvation
by the forgiveness of their sins.
<p>
In the tender compassion of our God
the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,
and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

	<h3>I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant</h3>
	
<strong>from Exodus 15	</strong>
	<p>
I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant;
horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.
<p>
My strength and my courage is the Lord,
and he has been my savior.
He is my God, I praise him;
the God of my father, I extol him.
<p>
The Lord is a warrior,
Lord is his name!
Pharaoh’s chariots and army he hurled into the sea.
At a breath of your anger the waters piled up,
the flowing waters stood like a mound,
the flood waters congealed in the midst of the sea.
<p>
The enemy boasted, “I will pursue and overtake them;
I will divide the spoils and have my fill of them;
I will draw my sword;
my hand shall despoil them!”
When your wind blew, the sea covered them;
like lead they sank in the mighty waters.
<p>
Who is like you among the gods, O Lord?
Who is like you, magnificent in holiness?
O terrible in renown, worker of wonders,
when you stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them!
<p>
In your mercy you led the people you redeemed;
in your strength you guided them to your holy dwelling.
<p>
And you brought them in and planted them
on the mountain of your inheritance-
the place where you made your seat, O Lord,
the sanctuary, O Lord, which your hands established.
The Lord shall reign forever and ever.

	<h3>If the Lord does not build the house</h3>
	
<strong>Psalm 127</strong>	
<p>
If the Lord does not build the house, in vain do its builders labor; 
if the Lord does not watch over the city, in vain does the watchman keep vigil.
</p>
<p>
In vain is your earlier rising, your going later to rest, 
you who toil for the bread you eat:
when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.
</p>

<p>
Truly sons are a gift from the Lord,
a blessing, the fruit of the womb.
Inndeed the sons of youth
are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.

O the happiness of the man
who has filled his quiver with these arrows!
He will have no cause for shame
when he disputes with his foes in the gateways.

I will bless the Lord at all times,
his praise always on my lips;
in the Lord my soul shall make its boast.
The humble shall hear and be glad.
<p>
Glorify the Lord with me.
Together let us praise his name.
I sought the Lord and he answered me;
from all my terrors he set me free.
<p>
Look towards him and be radiant;
let your faces not be abashed.
This poor man called; the Lord heard him
and rescued him from all his distress.
<p>
The angel of the Lord is encamped
around those who revere him, to rescue them.
Taste and see that the Lord is good.
He is happy who seeks refuge in him.
<p>
Revere the Lord, you his saints.
They lack nothing, those who revere him.
Strong lions suffer want and go hungry
but those who seek the Lord lack no blessing.

	<h3>Praising in Tongues</h3>


	<!-----begin tongues sections------>

	<div data-role="collapsible-set" data-theme="b" data-content-theme="c">

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Is it Catholic?</h3>




	
	<p>
   It is important to know that praying in tongues is not a requirement of being Catholic. However, it is also important to point out that praying in tongues is within the realms of Catholicism. It is not "Non-Catholic" or contrary to the Catholic Faith. It is permissible and can be very helpful to prayer. In many ways MyAdorationPal is a guide to help you pray for a long period of time in front of the Eucharist and so including this addtional and powerful method of prayer seems appropriate.
   	</p>
	
<p>
Of course, the beginning of references to praying in tongues for Christians comes from the account of Pentecost in the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts of the Apostles, the Apostles speak in tongues and everyone else understands in their native language. Many gathered are amazed and some even suggest the Apostles have been drinking. Peter stands up and explains it is early in the morning and no one has been drinking. 
</p>	
<p>
In Acts chapter 10, Peter decides that Gentiles can be baptized because when he preaches to the gentiles, the spirit falls on them and they speak in tongues. Based on this experience, Peter decides that Gentiles too can become Christians.
</p>

<blockquote>
44
p While Peter was still speaking these things, the holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the word.
45
The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that the gift of the holy Spirit should have been poured out on the Gentiles also,
46
for they could hear them speaking in tongues and glorifying God. Then Peter responded,
47
“Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these people, who have received the holy Spirit even as we have?”
48
He ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
</blockquote>


<p>
In Acts 19 when Paul travels to Ephesus, he learns that the Ephesians did not receive the Holy Spirit when they became believers. They were baptized only by John. So, Paul laid hands on them and "the Holy Spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied".
</p>

<p>
The most famous discussion on tongues occurs in Paul's letter to the Corinthians. Some people argue that Paul is suggesting to not pray in tongues. However, if you read the passage closely, you'll observe that Paul is not saying that at all. Instead, he says that if new people enter the communal gathering then it is best to not pray in tongues because the new people won't know what you are doing. Instead, it is better to use the gift of prophecy because it will cut to their heart and they will be converted. However, Paul points out, speaking in tongues can occur when new people are present, provided someone can interpret. The interpretation then would function like prophecy, which Paul encouraged when new people are around. 
</p>
<p>
If you think about it, the only reason Paul brings this up is because so many people in Corinth are praying in tongues. It is so common that he has to provide some guidance and order for its occurance. He laters says "So, (my) brothers, strive eagerly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues."

	<h3>Guidelines</h3>




<p>
Since St. Paul provided guidelines on praying in tonuges, we'll provide some guidance for you in case you'd like to add praising in tongues to your adoration time. 
<ul>
<li>Do not pray out loud in tongues unless everyone else in the room agrees it is time for out loud and prayer.
</li>
<li>Do not pray out loud in tongues unless everyone in the room either is familiar with tongues or is a strong enough member of the community to not leave the community if hearing tongues confuses him/her. Usually a person with a personal relationship with Jesus, even if hearing tongues for the first time, will not have his/her faith altered by hearing tongues. In many cases, the person will ask about what was heard and begin praying in tongues himself at a later time.</li>
<li>If it is not time for out loud prayer, consider praying in tongues in a soft whisper if you are far away enough so that know one can hear you.</li>
<li>If you are still too close to people, you can sometimes allow your tongue to move like you are praying in tongues without making any noise.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div>

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Types of Tongues</h3>




<p>
You can see from the above mentioned scripture passages that there are different types of praying in tongues.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Language Missionary Preaching:</strong> 
Like at Pentecost, tongues can be a missionary gift that allows preachers to reach the ears of people who do not understand the native language of the speaker. This gift is like a reversal of the punishment at the tower of Babel.</li>

<li><strong>Prophectic Tongues:</strong> 
Prophetic tongues is what Paul references in Corinthians 14 as a message in tongues that is interpreted. Someone speaks in tongues "to" the people gathered and someone else interprets the message. Because it is a message that seems to be from God, it is considered prophecy. Why does God share the gift of propehcy in tongues before having someone translate? Perhaps because it simply appears more miractulous and grabs our attention more.</li>


<li><strong>Personal Praise in Tongues:</strong> 
The individual praying in tongues is not preaching to convert or prophecying to those gathered. Instead, the person praying is simply giving praise to God with a pattern or language of speach that is unkown to the speaker. It may simply be a gift of non-language utterances to God. It could be another early language, and it could be an unknown heavenly language. In any manner, it is usually accompanied with a feeling of praise and thanksgiving and close communion with God. It can often feel as if the Holy Spirit is praising the Father and the Son through the individual who is praying. </li>

</ul>


<p>
It is the personal praise in tongues that will most likely accompany your time of praise in adoration. 
</p>

<blockquote>
Behold, he giveth as it were the tune of thy song; seek not words as if thou couldest explain whereby God is pleased. Sing with jubilation: for this is to sing skilfully unto God, to sing with jubilation. What is it to sing with jubilation ? To be unable to understand, to express in words, what is sung in the heart. For singers, either in the harvest, or in the vineyard, or in any other busy work, after they have begun in the words of their hymns to exult and rejoice, being as it were filled with so great joy, that they cannot express it in words, then turn from actual words, and proceed to sounds of jubilation. The jubilee is a sound signifying that the heart laboureth with that which it cannot utter. And whom beseemeth that jubilation, but the Ineffable God? For He is Ineffable, Whom thou canst not speak; and if thou canst not speak Him, and oughtest not to keep Him silent, what remaineth to thee but jubilation ; that the heart may rejoice without words, and the boundless extent of joy may have no limits of syllables? Sing skilfully unto Him with jubilation.
<em>—Augustine of Hippo on the 33 Psalm</em>
</blockquote>

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Beyond Words</h3>



<p>
In Romans 8, St. Paul discusses the Spirit intreceding on our behalf with groanings too deep for human words to understand, but the Father who searches all hearts understands. Personal praise in tongues or "jubilation" as Augustine calls it, is the type of tongues that can be very helpful to you during your time of praise before the Eucharist in Adoration. If you think about it, you are in the presence of the person of Jesus Christ. You have been baptized and have received the Holy Spirit. It is not surprising that the Holy Spirit inside wants to cry out to Jesus in a language or manner that is different or beyond the language your brain knows. Even if tongues is not a "language" as we define language, it still makes sense that the Holy Spirit would desire for to express our adoration for the Son in a manner beyond that of our native tongue. 
</p>
<p>
Why do couple's kiss or hold hands? Why don't they just say "I love you". Kissing and holding hands does say I love you, but it says in a different way. Why yell "wooo hooo" when your sports team scores? Why not yell, "I am most excited now". Why say "mmmmmmhhhhhh" when eating a delicious brownie? Why not say, "This brownie is delicious". Why write a poem for a loved one when you could just say what you feel? Why is there a song that says "Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, Zip-A-Dee-Day"? Well, of course the reasons for these expressions and non language utterances is because sometimes English does not suffice. Sometimes we need to step out of or beyond our language to express what we feel. Tongues, or jublition, is in many ways a gift of the Holy Spirit to help our brains and spirits step beyond or outside of our normal language oriented brain and into a realm of expressive thanksgiving.  Because it is a gift and allows us to make this step, it is a wonderful tool for praising God, which noted earlier is "our duty and our salvation".

	<h3>How to Pray in Tongues</h3>
<p>
Suppose you've never prayed in tongues and would like to give it a try. First, acknowledge that you'd like to receive the gift of tongues for persponal praise and thanksgiving (jubilation). Focus on giving God thanks and praise and ask for the gift of tongues to help you praise more. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Holy Spirit comes to our aid in our weakness. </strong><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
In the same way, the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.
27
And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit, because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God’s will.
</blockquote>

<p>
St. Paul tells us that we do not know how to pray as we ought. Admiting that we do not know how to pray is a wondeful way to begin all prayer, especially when asking for the gift of tongues. So, admit that you do not know how to pray as you ought. You are not alone. St. Paul felt the same way. Now, as you feel helpless, begin to depend on God for the gift of prayer. Depend on the Holy Spirit to help you, to intercede on your behalf. Ask God out loud to give you the gift of tongues to help you give him praise. Tell him you'd like to praise him more than you are able to right now. Then, begin to make utterances with your mouth. Make up some syllales to say and just start saying them. Youg might start with "ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da". 
</p>

<p>
By making some noises, you are stepping out in faith and giving the Holy Spirit something to work with. Consider making the sounds for about 45 seconds. After making the sounds, praise God out loud with English words that you do know. Refer to the Praise Bank section if you need help. Then, try the syllable sounds again, such as "ba da, ba da, ba da, ba da.". Try these about three times or more if you wish. 
</p>

<p>
You may find the Holy Spirit helping you right away and your tongue will beging to move quickly, almost as if you are not realy controlling it. You might have a tingling sensatino on your throat or in your mouth which seems to indicate to you that the Holy Spirit is very present. It is also possible that after asking for the gift that you do not receive the gift of tongues. This is okay. Many people have received the gift at an unexpected time later in the day or week. Some wake up in the middle of the night and find themselves praying in tongues. The important thing is that you desire to give God thanks and praise and that you've asked for the gift and tried to pray in tongues on your own. You can repeat this process daily if you'd like. 
</p>

<p>The majority of people who ask for and pray for the gift of tongues do end of up receiving it. However, as noted above, praying in tongues is not required for being Catholic. It does not mean you are any more or elss holy if you pray in tongues. In fact it is a gift to help us because we are so bad at praying on our own. No one who prays in tongues should ever pressure or tease someone who does not have the gift. On the other hand, those without the gift should not be too quick to make up excuses for why they have not tried or opened themselves up to the gift. Many times excuses are made not because a someone is afraid of praying in tongues, but because they are afraid of surrendering their entire life to God. They figure that if the Holy Spirit begins to take over their prayer life, then He might want to take over the rest of their lives. They prefer a type of relationship with God in which they are in the driver's seat. Tongues is an outward sign that prayer is a two-way street and that religion is a relationship and not only a routine. Sometimes this reminder can be hard to swallow. </p>


<blockquote>
<strong>From the Confessions of St. Patrick:</strong> <br>
And another night– God knows, I do not, whether within me or beside me– most words which I heard and could not understand, except at the end of the speech it was represented thus: 'He who gave his life for you, he it is who speaks within you.' And thus I awoke, joyful.[38]
And on a second occasion I saw Him praying within me, and I was as it were, inside my own body , and I heard Him above me—that is, above my inner self. He was praying powerfully with sighs. And in the course of this I was astonished and wondering, and I pondered who it could be who was praying within me. But at the end of the prayer it was revealed to me that it was the Spirit. And so I awoke and remembered the Apostle's words: "Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for utterance [Romans 8:26]." And again: "The Lord our advocate intercedes for us [Romans 8:27].

<div class="guide-section">

<h3>Blessing</h3>

<p>
When it is your turn for 
Confession, sit down in the chair or kneel at the kneeler near the priest. He 
may give you a blessing as you are sitting down. You then say: </p>
		<strong>"Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been ___ months(weeks/years) since my last confession. These are my sins."  
	
		</strong>  
	
</div>


<div class="guide-section">
	
<h3>Confession</h3>	
<p>
	Now, share your sins.<span class="smaller"> If you used the Prepare for Confession section of this app, your 
	sins will appear below. Some have "and/or" statements and you may only need to 
	say one of the options included.</span></p>
	
	<div id="sinArea">You sins will show up here if you use the "<a href="#prepare">Prepare for Confession</a>" section of this app.</div>
	
	
	<p>
	The priest may ask a clarifying question or two about your sins. He will then give advice and counsel. He will also give some form of penance to do after the confession. It may be a prayer, a meditation, or some action. 
	</p>
	
	
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
<h3>	Act of Contrition:</h3>	

 <p>
	The priest may ask you to say the following prayer. Or, he may ask you to pray it later. 
	
	<p>
	
	<strong>"My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.
                  In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,
                  I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.
                  I firmly intend, with your help, to do penance, to sin no more,
                  and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.
                  Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.
                  In His name, my God, have mercy.
                  Amen."
	
	</strong>
	
	</p>
</div>

<div class="guide-section">	
	
	
	<h3>Absolution </h3> 
	
	<p>
	The priest will extend his hand and say the prayer of absolution. Bow your head while he prays and receive the forgiveness of Christ.
		</p>
		
		
		<p>
		
		The priest may give you a final blessing. If the final 
		blessing ends in "Go in peace," you respond: 
		<p>		<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
		
		
		
		<p>
		You can thank the priest as you leave.
		</p>

</div><!---end absolution--->

<div class="guide-section">
		<h3>Penance</h3>
		<p>
		Remember to do the prayers or acts of penance the priest gave you. Doing the act of penance completes the Sacrament of Confession.
